    </ul>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion,<br> garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 <br>minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture <br>through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in <br>the food mill. </li>
        <li> In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour<br> to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a <br>bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season <br>with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste. </li>
    </ol>
